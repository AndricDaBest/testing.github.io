		<ul>
		<li style="color:white;"><img src="monitor.png" /><br>
		A monitor is an electronic visual computer display that includes a screen, circuitry and the case in which that circuitry is enclosed. Older computer 
		monitors made use of cathode ray tubes (CRT), which made them large,<br> heavy and inefficient. Nowadays, flat-screen LCD monitors are used in devices like 
		laptops, PDAs and desktop computers because they are lighter and more energy efficient. A monitor is also known as a screen or a visual display unit (VDU).<hr /><br><br>
		
		<li style="color:white;"><img src="keyboard.jpg" /><br>
		A keyboard is a peripheral device that enables a user to input text into a computer or any other electronic machinery. A keyboard is an input device and 
		is the most basic way for the user to communicate with a computer.<br> This device is patterned after its predecessor, the typewriter, from which the keyboard
		inherited its layout, although the keys or letters are arranged to function as electronic switches. The keys include punctuation, <br>alphanumeric and special
		keys like the Windows key and various multimedia keys, which have specific functions assigned to them.<hr /><br><br>
		
		<li style="color:white;"><img src="mouse.png" width="30%"/><br>
		A mouse is a small handheld input device that controls a computer screen's cursor or pointer in conjunction with the way it is moved on a flat surface. 
		The mouse term name originates from its likeness to a small, corded<br> and elliptical shaped device that looks like a mouse tail. Some mouse devices have 
		integrated features, such as extra buttons that may be programmed and assigned with different commands.<hr /><br><br>
		
		<li style="color:white;"><img src="gpu.png" /><br>
		(Graphics Processing Unit) A programmable logic chip (processor) specialized for display functions. The GPU renders images, animations and video for 
		the computer's screen. GPUs are located on plug-in cards, in a chipset on<br> the motherboard or in the same chip as the CPU A GPU performs parallel operations. 
		Although it is used for 2D data as well as for zooming and panning the screen, a GPU is essential for smooth decoding and rendering of 3D <br>animations and video. 
		The more sophisticated the GPU, the higher the resolution and the faster and smoother the motion in games and movies. GPUs on stand-alone cards include their 
		own memory (RAM), while GPUs in the <br>chipset or CPU chip share main memory with the CPU.<hr /><br><br>
		
		<li style="color:white;"><img src="psu.jpg" width="30%" /><br>
		A power supply is a hardware component that supplies power to an electrical device. It receives power from an electrical outlet and converts the current 
		from AC (alternating current) to DC (direct current), which is what the computer requires.<br> It also regulates the voltage to an adequate amount, which 
		allows the computer to run smoothly without overheating. The power supply an integral part of any computer and must function correctly for the rest of 
		the components to work.<hr /><br><br>
		
		<li style="color:white;"><img src="motherboard.jpeg" width="30%" /><br>
		A motherboard is the main printed circuit board (PCB) in a computer. The motherboard is a computerâ€™s central communications backbone connectivity point, 
		through which all components and external peripherals connect.The large PCB of a <br>motherboard may include 6-14 layers of fiberglass, copper connecting traces 
		and copper planes for power and signal isolation. Additional components can be added to a motherboard through its expansion slots. These may include processor 
		<br>sockets, DIMM, HTX, PCI, PCIe and M.2 slots as well as power supply connections.<hr /><br><br>

		<li style="color:white;"><img src="headset.jpg" width="30%" /><br>
		A headset is a hardware device that connects to a telephone or computer that allow the user to talk and listen while keeping their hands free.<br><br>
		
		<li style="color:white;"><img src="fan.jpg" /><br>
		A computer fan is any fan inside, or attached to, a computer case used for active cooling, and may refer to fans that draw cooler air into the case from the outside, 
		expel warm air from inside, or move air across a heat sink to cool a particular component. <br>Generally these are found in axial and sometimes centrifugal forms. 
		The former is sometimes called an "electric" fan, after the Rotron Vertical line, while the latter may be called a "biscuit blower"in some 
		product literature.<hr /><br><br>
		
		<li style="color:white;"><img src="cpu.jpg" width="30%" /><br>
		A processor, or "microprocessor," is a small chip that resides in computers and other electronic devices. Its basic job is to receive input and provide the appropriate 
		output. While this may seem like a simple task, modern processors can handle trillions of calculations <br>per second.The central processor of a computer is also known as 
		the CPU, or "central processing unit." This processor handles all the basic system instructions, such as processing mouse and keyboard input and running applications. 
		Most desktop computers contain a <br>CPU developed by either Intel or AMD, both of which use the x86 processor architecture. Mobile devices, such as laptops and tablets may 
		use Intel and AMD CPUs, but can also use specific mobile processors developed by companies like ARM or Apple.<hr /><br><br>
		
		<li style="color:white;"><img src="heatsink.jpg" width="30%" /><br>
		A heat sink is a thermal conductive metal device designed to absorb and disperse heat away from a high temperature object such as a computer processor.
		Usually heat sinks are outfitted with built-in fans to help keep both the CPU and the heat sink at an appropriate temperature. <br>Heat sinks are made out of 
		metal, such as a copper or aluminum alloy, and are attached to the processor. Most heat sinks have fins, thin slices of metal connected to the base of the 
		heat sink, which help spread heat over a large area.<hr />
